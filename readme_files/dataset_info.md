# Code1 Dataset: DEAM (Dataset for Emotion Analysis in Music)

## Overview
DEAM is a dataset designed for emotion analysis in music. It contains annotations of music tracks with emotional attributes, facilitating studies in music information retrieval (MIR), machine learning, and affective computing.

## Content
- **Music Tracks**:
  - Contains short music excerpts (typically 45 seconds).
  - Tracks cover diverse genres and styles to ensure a broad emotional range.
- **Annotations**:
  - **Valence and Arousal Ratings**: Emotional attributes are rated on a scale (e.g., valence for positivity/negativity, arousal for intensity).
  - **Continuous Annotations**: Emotional changes over time are captured using continuous ratings.
  - **Static Annotations**: Global ratings representing overall emotional impressions of the tracks.
- **Metadata**:
  - Includes details like genre, tempo, and other musical features.

## Applications
- Music emotion recognition and classification.
- Study of dynamic emotional responses to music.
- Training and benchmarking machine learning models for MIR.

## Key Features
- Time-series emotional labels, enabling analysis of emotional evolution.
- Rich genre diversity, making it suitable for generalized emotion modeling.

# Code2 Dataset: EMOPIA (EMOtional POPIAno Dataset)

## Overview
EMOPIA is a dataset crafted for studying emotion in piano music, with a focus on pop piano performances. It supports tasks in MIR, music generation, and computational musicology.

## Content
- **Piano Tracks**:
  - Composed of MIDI files for pop piano performances.
  - Tracks emphasize expressiveness and emotional variation.
- **Annotations**:
  - **Emotion Quadrants**: Songs are labeled based on Russellâ€™s Circumplex Model of Affect:
    - **Q1**: High valence, high arousal (e.g., happy, excited).
    - **Q2**: Low valence, high arousal (e.g., angry, tense).
    - **Q3**: Low valence, low arousal (e.g., sad, melancholic).
    - **Q4**: High valence, low arousal (e.g., calm, relaxed).
  - **Valence and Arousal Scores**: Detailed annotations indicate emotional intensity and positivity.
- **Performance Dynamics**:
  - Captures expressive elements like velocity, tempo, and timing, reflecting emotional nuances.

## Applications
- Emotion classification in music.
- Emotional music generation and composition.
- Study of expressiveness in musical performance.

## Key Features
- MIDI format enables fine-grained analysis of musical components.
- Focus on piano as a solo instrument, with emphasis on emotional subtleties.
